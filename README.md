## Contributing

It would be really rather wonderful if people contributed examples of different techniques synchronised with the examples in the Umbraco Documentation.

For the time-being, create a folder for the 'type of example' at the root of the solution, we will advise if it should be a subfolder of something else, but main thing is to get buildable, workable, usable examples in place!

Only commit the Umbraco.sqlite.db file back in your contribution, if you have needed to change the Umbraco implementation to illustrate your example, we're trying to keep it as close to the shipped starter kit, so if something in there can be re-purposed to illustrate the example, then use that first. If not it's ok to add new DocTypes, Properties if it will help make the examples more real world and clearer!
